    <h1>Below is a list of websites that may be useful for learning Responsive Web Design</h1>

    <ul>
      <li><p><a href="http://w3schools.com">W3Schools</a><br />
        W3 Schools is great! This is where I learned almost everything I know about HMTL/CSS/JS. The tutorials are clear and to-the-point.</p></li>
      <li><p><a href="https://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a><br />
        Bootstrap's homepage is full of documentation and examples. Of course, the website itself is built using the Bootstrap framework, so sometimes the best trick is just to view the page source to see how it's done.</p></li>
      <li><p><a href="https://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a><br />
        John Gruber has blogged and podcasted about design for decades. He has strong opinions about product design, web design, and software design.</p></li>
      <li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">Wikipedia</a><br />
        Web designers love to build web pages, so Wikipedia pages about web design get lots of love. The page about Responsive Web Design alone has over 50 references.</p></li>
      <li><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com">Ars Technica</a><br />
        Ars Technica is a lesser-known Conde Nast publication, but is possibly the best technology magazine on the internet. Searching for "Responsive Web Design" produces hundreds of useful articles.</p></li>
      <li><p><a href="http://lynda.com">Lynda.com</a><br />
        Lynda publishes the best video training materials in the technology industry. There is plenty of content around front-end development tools like Bootstrap.</p></li>
      <li><p><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/responsive/">Google - Responsive Web Design Basics</a><br />
        I found this article, unsurprisingly, by googling around. It is a very well-organized and thorough introduction to Responsive Web Design. Google describes their Web Fundamentals pages as their "opinionated reference for building amazing web experiences."</p></li>
